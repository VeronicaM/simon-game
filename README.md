 Click start to play the game. Watch the buttons that are being lit and reproduce the sequence by clicking on the buttons. Check the strict checkbox to have the game reinitialize from 0 everytime you miss a step in the sequence. Play the start button again if you wish to restart with a 1 step sequence. You win the game by guessing 20 consecutive steps. Have fun playing !
